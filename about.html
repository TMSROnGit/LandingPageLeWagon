              <h2>We believe that everyone can continuously thrive in their careers.</h2>

              <h2>Why 'Le Wagon'?</h2>
              <p>As we say in French : L’éducation supérieure a 'un wagon de retard'. <br /> <br /> 

                An idiom that could be literally translated into: 'Higher education has missed the train'. <br /> <br />
                
                It points to this idea of a 'missing block' or 'missing wagon' in the “train of higher education”. And a wagon is a vehicle that takes a group of people (like a class of students) on a journey to a destination. This is exactly what our bootcamps are about!<br /> <br />
